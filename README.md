# Political-Survey---Analysis

TASK 1:

As per the requirements, I have taken the survey data.
From the details file, I have matched the party names for the years 2012,2014,2017,2019.
Initially I have studied the data and proceeded with some data cleaning.
I have calculated the value counts for each party for the given years.
Then I have Created separate Data frame with party name and year based on the votes for each party.
Proceeding with that, I have converted the votes into percentage for every year and then performed prediction in the basis of probability for year 2022.
Here, I have applied Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) method and tried to generalize the survey data.
Then Data Visualization is done by using some plots.
I have used Bar Plot, Box Plot, Scatter Plot, Line Plot, KDE Plot, Factor Plot to plot the data.
The following columns are taken as X and Y factors for plot.
Party Name vs Vote Share
Party Name vs years (2012,2014,2017)
Years (2012,2014,2017) vs Vote Share.
Later as per the task, I have done aggregation and grouping. I have performed Age wise, Gender wise and Caste wise Party Vote distribution.
I have Performed the same for district and assembly vote distribution for all parties.


TASK 2:

Here, I have taken Booth Data.
For Years 2012, 2014, 2017, I took assembly 88.
To categorise booth number, I found maximum vote share on respective booth for the parties.

Here, I have used the given data for Data Analysis in Tableau. I have done the data analysis And it is represented as Tableau Dashboard.

Dashboard 1: It represents four analyses. Party Name vs Vote Share in Horizontal bar. (This represents Sum of Vote Share for each Party Name) Party Name vs Vote Share in Packed Bubbles. (In this, Colour shows the details about Party Name, Size shows the Sum of Vote share. The Marks are labelled by Party Name) Party Name vs 2012 in Pie Chart. (In this, Colour shows the Party Name, Size shows the Sum of the Year 2012) Vote Share vs 2012 in Tree Map. (In this, Colour and size shows the Sum of Vote Share. The Marks are labelled by the year 2012.)

Dashboard 2: It represents three analyses. Vote Share vs 2017 in Horizontal Bar. (This represents Sum of Vote Share in 2017) Vote Share vs 2014 in Heat Maps. (This represents Sum of Vote Share broken down by the year 2014) Vote Share vs 2019 in Packed Bubbles. (In this, Colour shows the details about 2019, Size shows the Sum of Vote share. The Marks are labelled by the year 2019)

Dashboard 3: Party Name vs 2014 in Box and Whisker plots. (This represents Sum of 2014. The Party Names are shown as Details.) Party Name vs 2017 in Circle View. (This represents Sum of 2017. The Party Names are shown as Details.) Party Name vs 2019 in Stacked Bars. (This represents Sum of 2019. The Party Names are shown as Details.)
